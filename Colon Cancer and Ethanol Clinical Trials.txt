Chemoprevention represents an attractive modality against colorectal cancer (CRC) although widespread clinical implementation of promising agents (e.g. aspirin/NSAIDS) have been stymied by both suboptimal efficacy and concerns over toxicity. This highlights the need for better agents. Several groups, including our own, have reported that the over-the-counter laxative polyethylene glycol (PEG) has remarkable efficacy in rodent models of colon carcinogenesis. In this study, we undertook the first randomized human trial to address the role of PEG in prevention of human colonic neoplasia. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm trial where eligible subjects were randomized to 8g PEG-3350 (n = 27) or 17g PEG-3350 (n = 24), or placebo (n = 24; maltodextrin) orally for a duration of six months. Our initial primary endpoint was rectal aberrant crypt foci (ACF) but this was changed during protocol period to rectal mucosal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Of the 87 patients randomized, 48 completed study primary endpoints and rectal EGFR unchanged PEG treatment. Rectal ACF had a trend suggesting potentially reduction with PEG treatment (pre-post change 1.7 in placebo versus -0.3 in PEG 8+ 17g doses, p = 0.108). Other endpoints (proliferation, apoptosis, expression of SNAIL and E-cadherin), previously noted to be modulated in rodent models, appeared unchanged with PEG treatment in this clinical trial. We conclude that PEG was generally well tolerated with the trial failing to meet primary efficacy endpoints. However, rectal ACFs demonstrated a trend (albeit statistically insignificant) for suppression with PEG. Moreover, all molecular assays including EGFR were unaltered with PEG underscoring issues with lack of translatability of biomarkers from preclinical to clinical trials. This data may provide the impetus for future clinical trials on PEG using more robust biomarkers of chemoprevention.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00828984.

Because of its volume, adequate bowel preparation remains problematic in physically unfit patients.This study aimed to compare a small-volume sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate preparation with a 2-L ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl.This study has a noninferiority design, assuming that ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl is 70% efficacious in achieving an Ottawa score ≤7 and accepting a difference in success rate of <15% with a target enrollment of 146 patients per group.This study was conducted in an outpatient department.Patients referred for diagnostic colonoscopy were randomly assigned. Key exclusion criteria were severe kidney disease, ASA class ≥III, and hospital admission.Patients were randomly assigned to receive sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate or ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl according to a split-dose regimen. Patients in the sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate group received advice on the recommended 4-L fluid intake. Patients in the ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl group received 2 bisacodyl tablets 2 days before and advice on the additionally recommended 2-L fluid intake.To assess bowel-cleansing adequacy, the Ottawa, Aronchick, and Boston scores were used. Colonoscopy quality measures were obtained. Safety was assessed for a 30-day follow-up period.Overall, 341 patients (169 men, mean age 57.0 years; BMI 26.2 kg/m) were included. Comorbidities were present in 76.2% of patients, and 75.4% of patients used medication. An adequate Ottawa score was obtained in 81.4% and 75.8% of patients receiving ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate (difference of 5.6% (95% CI, -3.5 to -14.6; p = 0.023)), showing noninferiority of the sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate therapy. Ottawa segmental scores were lower for sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate in the right and transverse colon. In both groups, successful ileocecal intubation was achieved in 95%. No medication-related adverse events were reported.These results in a physically disabled ambulant population cannot be extrapolated to immobile, hospitalized patients.Sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate proved to be noninferior to ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl in efficacy and safety. Timing of the colonoscopy and addition of bisacodyl to sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate warrants further consideration. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A461.

Although a split regimen of bowel preparation has been associated with higher levels of bowel cleansing, it is still uncertain whether it has a favourable effect on the adenoma detection rate (ADR). The present study was aimed at evaluating whether a split regimen was superior to the traditional 'full-dose, day-before' regimen in terms of ADR.In a multicentre, randomised, endoscopist-blinded study, 50-69-year-old subjects undergoing first colonoscopy after positive-faecal immunochemical test within an organised colorectal cancer organised screening programmes were 1:1 randomised to receive low-volume 2-L polyethylene glycol (PEG)-ascorbate solution in a 'split-dose' (Split-Dose Group, SDG) or 'day-before' regimen (Day-Before Group, DBG). The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with at least one adenoma. Secondary endpoints were the detection rates of advanced adenomas and serrated lesions at per-patient analysis and the total number of lesions.690 subjects were included in the study. At per-patient analysis, the proportion of subjects with at least one adenoma was significantly higher in the SDG than in the DBG (183/345, 53.0% vs 141/345, 40.9%, relative risk (RR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.46); corresponding figures for advanced adenomas were 26.4% (91/345) versus 20.0% (69/345, RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.73). At per-polyp analysis, the total numbers of both adenomas and advanced adenomas per subject were significantly higher in the SDG (1.15 vs 0.8, p <0.001; 0.36 vs 0.22, p<0.001).In an organised screening setting, the adoption of a split regimen resulted into a higher detection rate of clinically relevant neoplastic lesions, thus improving the effectiveness of colonoscopy. Based on such evidence, the adoption of a split regimen for colonoscopy should be strongly recommended.NCT02178033.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

To validate the usefulness of sennoside as a substitute for polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) for elective colon cancer surgery.We performed a prospective randomized non-inferiority trial comparing the use of sennoside and PEG in MBP for elective colon cancer surgery, in terms of the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) and the feasibility of surgery.The overall incidence of SSIs was 2.9 % in the sennoside group (n = 68) and 6.3 % in the PEG group (n = 63) with a difference of 3.4 % (95 % confidence interval 6.9-10.6 %). The intraoperative spillage of the stool materials in the sennoside and PEG groups was 4.4 and 3.1 %, respectively, and was not significantly different (p = 0.71), even the upstream stool consistency, was more frequently observed to be non-stool in the PEG group (65.1 vs. 30.9 %, p < 0.01).MBP with sennoside could be a substitution for PEG in elective colon cancer surgery.Colon cancer; Mechanical bowel preparation; Polyethylene glycol; Sennoside

AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2015 Apr;204(4):W429-38. doi: 10.2214/AJR.14.13024.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the occurrence of numerous colonic bubbles during CT colonography (CTC) performed with polyethylene glycol cleansing and oral iohexol fecal/fluid tagging could be prevented by use of simethicone.Adults with suspected colonic neoplasia who had been randomly assigned to control and simethicone intervention groups underwent CTC after cleansing with 4 L of polyethylene glycol, tagging with 50 mL of 350 mg I/mL oral iohexol, and without (control) or with (intervention) oral administration of 200 mg of simethicone. Colonic segments in the control and intervention groups were evaluated for amount of colonic bubbles during CTC. A 6-point grading system was used in which 0 indicated no bubbles and 5 indicated that more than three fourths of the air-distended mucosa was covered with bubbles. The primary endpoint was a per-patient colonic bubble grade, derived as an average of the segmental grades.Eighty adults with suspected colonic neoplasia were randomly assigned to the control (40 patients) and simethicone intervention (40 patients) groups. A total of 659 colonic segments in the control group and 689 segments in the intervention group were evaluated for amount of colonic bubbles during CTC. The per-patient colonic bubble score was significantly lower in the simethicone intervention group than in the control group. The mean score was 0.0±0.1 (SD) versus 1.2±0.8 (p<0.001; 95% CI for the mean difference, -1.4 to -1.0). In the intervention group, 673 (97.7%) segments were grade 0, and 16 (2.3%) were grade 1. In contrast, in the control group, 226 (34.3%) segments were grade 0; 173 (26.3%), grade 1; 175 (26.6%), grade 2; 45 (6.8%), grade 3; 23 (3.5%), grade 4; and 17 (2.6%), grade 5.The colonic bubbles associated with fecal/fluid tagging with iohexol can be successfully prevented by adding simethicone to the colonic preparation.CT colonography; bubbles; iohexol; simethicone; tagging

3-L split-dose is superior to 2-L polyethylene glycol in bowel cleansing in Chinese population: a multicenter randomized, controlled trial.
Zhang S1, Li M, Zhao Y, Lv T, Shu Q, Zhi F, Cui Y, Chen M.
Medicine (Baltimore). 2015 Jan;94(4):e472. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000000472.
Large volume (4 L) of polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution would ensure a better quality of bowel cleansing but might be poorly tolerated. Due to the smaller body size, lower body weight, and different diet habits, the large volume of 4-L PEG might be poorly tolerated by the Chinese population. In view of this, a balance should be made between the volume and effectiveness. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness, compliance, and safety between 3-L split-dose and 2-L PEG in Chinese population. Consecutive patients scheduled for colonoscopy were recruited from 5 tertiary medical centers in South China between April and July, 2014. Patients were prospectively randomized into 2 groups: 3-L split-dose PEG (3L-group) and 2 L PEG (2L-group). The primary endpoint was bowel cleansing and was defined according to Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS). The safety and compliance were also evaluated. A total of 318 patients were included in the analysis. The mean total OBPS score was significantly higher in 2L-group than in 3L-group (4.4 ± 2.7 vs 2.9 ± 2.4, P < 0.001). Both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis found that rates of successful and excellent bowel preparation were much higher in 3L-group (89.9% and 78.0%) than 2L-group (79.2% and 48.4%), respectively (P < 0.001). The average cecum intubation time was significantly shorter in 3L-group (8.2 ± 3.7 min) than in 2L-group (10.3 ± 4.2 min) (P = 0.04). Adenoma detection rate in right colon was slightly higher in 3L-group than in 2L-group (17.6% vs 12.6%, P = 0.21). The safety and compliance including the taste, smell, and dosage of PEG were similar between 2 groups (P > 0.05). 3-L split-dose PEG is superior to 2-L PEG by better bowel cleansing, improved safety and compliance, shorter cecum intubation time, and potentially higher adenoma detection rate in rightward colon in Chinese population.

A randomized study in 1999-2005 of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) preceding colonic resection found no decrease in postoperative complications. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term effect of MBP regarding cancer recurrence and survival after colonic resections.The cohort of patients with colonic cancer in the MBP study was followed up for 10 years. Data were collected from registers run by the National Board of Health and Welfare. Register data were validated against information in patient charts. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable analysis of factors predictive of cancer-specific survival.Register analysis showed significantly fewer recurrences, and better cancer-specific and overall survival in the MBP group. After validation, 839 of 1343 patients remained for analysis (448 MBP, 391 no MBP). Eighty (17·9 per cent) of 448 patients in the MBP group and 88 (22·5 per cent) of 391 in the no-MBP group developed a cancer recurrence (P = 0·093). The 10-year cancer-specific survival rate was 84·1 per cent in the MBP group and 78·0 per cent in the no-MBP group (P = 0·019). Overall survival rates were 58·8 and 56·0 per cent respectively (P = 0·186).Patients receiving MBP before elective colonic cancer surgery had significantly better cancer-specific survival after 10 years.© 2014 BJS Society Ltd.

To compare the bowel cleansing efficacy of same day ingestion of 4-L sulfa-free polyethylene glycol (4-L SF-PEG) vs 2-L polyethylene glycol solution with ascorbic acid (2-L PEG + Asc) in patients undergoing afternoon colonoscopy.206 patients (mean age 56.7 years, 61% male) undergoing outpatient screening or surveillance colonoscopies were prospectively randomized to receive either 4-L SF-PEG (n = 104) or 2-L PEG + Asc solution (n = 102). Colonoscopies were performed by two blinded endoscopists. Bowel preparation was graded using the Ottawa scale. Each participant completed a satisfaction and side effect survey.There was no difference in patient demographics amongst groups. 4-L SF-PEG resulted in better Ottawa scores compared to 2-L PEG + Asc, 4.2 vs 4.9 (P = 0.0186); left colon: 1.33 vs 1.57 respectively (P = 0.0224), right colon: 1.38 vs 1.63 respectively (P = 0.0097). No difference in Ottawa scores was found for the mid colon or amount of fluid. Patient satisfaction was similar for both arms but those assigned to 4-L SF-PEG reported less bloating: 23.1% vs 11.5% (P = 0.0235). Overall polyp detection, adenomatous polyp and advanced adenoma detection rates were similar between the two groups.Morning only 4-L SF-PEG provided superior cleansing with less bloating as compared to 2-L PEG + Asc bowel preparation for afternoon colonoscopy. Thus, future studies evaluating efficacy of morning only preparation for afternoon colonoscopy should use 4-L SF-PEG as the standard comparator.Bowel preparation; Colon cancer screening; Colonoscopy; Screening colonoscopy

Clin Chem Lab Med. 2014 Nov;52(11):1649-55. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2014-0096.
Only a limited number of cytotoxic drugs have shown activity in metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Patupilone is a novel agent with promising activity in this common cancer. Diarrhea represents the dose-limiting toxicity of patupilone. Measurement of intestinal permeability is one of the potential methods of non-invasive laboratory assessment of gastrointestinal toxicity.We have assessed intestinal permeability by measuring absorption of lactulose, mannitol and xylose in 27 previously treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer enrolled in a phase I trial of patupilone.Lactulose/mannitol and lactulose/xylose ratios increased after the treatment. Significantly higher lactulose/mannitol ratio was observed in patients who had severe diarrhea. Moreover, patients who subsequently had an adverse event of grade 3 or higher had significantly higher baseline lactulose/mannitol or lactulose/xylose ratios.Measurement of intestinal permeability using the lactulose/mannitol test may represent a biomarker for the monitoring, or even prediction of toxicity of cytotoxic drugs, including patupilone.

Colonoscopy is one of the most reliable methods for the detection of colorectal neoplasms. However, colonic peristalsis during colonoscopy results in some neoplastic lesions being hidden from view and commonly requires an intravenous or intramuscular injection of antispasmodic agents, which may sometimes causes unexpected adverse reactions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of L-menthol spray as an antiperistaltic agent and its effect on adenoma detection.This was a prospective, randomized, single-blind placebo-controlled trial. A total of 226 patients who were scheduled to undergo colonoscopy were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mL of 1.6 % L-menthol (n = 118) or placebo (n = 108). Both treatments were sprayed locally onto the colonic mucosa via an endoscope. The adenoma detection rate (ADR) and the proportion of patients with no peristalsis were the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.The ADR was significantly higher in the L-menthol group than in the placebo group (60.2 % vs. 42.6 %; P = 0.0083). The proportion of patients with no peristalsis after treatment with L-menthol was significantly higher than in the placebo group (71.2 % vs. 30.9 %; P < 0.0001). There were no adverse effects in either group.The results suggest that the suppression of colonic peristalsis by L-menthol sprayed directly onto the colonic mucosa improves the ADR.ID: UMIN 000007972.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

Gut Liver. 2013 Nov;7(6):681-7. doi: 10.5009/gnl.2013.7.6.681. Epub 2013 Aug 14.
A dietary regimen consisting of a clear liquid diet (CLD) for at least 24 hours is recommended for colonoscopy preparation. However, this requirement results in problems in patient compliance with bowel preparation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a CLD compared with a regular diet (RD) for colonoscopy preparation using a polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution.This was a multicenter, randomized, investigator-blind prospective study. A total of 801 healthy outpatients undergoing afternoon colonoscopy were randomized to either a CLD or RD in addition to a 4 L PEG regimen.The quality of bowel cleansing was not different between the CLD and RD groups in terms of the proportion with excellent or good preparation. In addition, no significant differences were observed between the two groups for polyp and adenoma detection rates and overall adverse events. Good compliance with bowel preparation was higher in the RD group than in the CLD group.A CLD for a full day prior to colonoscopy should not be mandatory for PEG-based bowel preparation. Dietary education concerning the avoidance of high-fiber foods for 3 days before colonoscopy is sufficient, at least for healthy outpatients.Afternoon colonoscopy; Bowel preparation; Clear liquid diet; Regular diet

Digestion. 2013;88(2):110-8. doi: 10.1159/000353244. Epub 2013 Aug 15.
Split-dose polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a standard bowel preparation regimen for colonoscopy, but the large volume is burdensome to ingest and the night dose causes sleep disturbance. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a bowel preparation protocol using low-volume morning-only PEG with specially designed low-residue test meals (LV-PEG with TM) compared to a standard-volume split-dose PEG bowel preparation with a standard diet (SV-PEG with SD).This was a single-center, prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, noninferiority study. The primary end point was bowel preparation quality according to the Ottawa scale. Tolerability, compliance, adverse events, sleep quality and polyp/adenoma detection were also assessed.Among 197 patients analyzed (mean age 54.6 years, 51.3% men), 97 received LV-PEG with TM and 100 received SV-PEG with SD. The Ottawa score for the total colon was 3.76 ± 2.07 in the LV-PEG with TM group and 3.67 ± 1.57 in the SV-PEG with SD group (p = 0.723; difference 0.09, 95% confidence interval -0.60 to 0.42). The compliance was high (more than 95%) in both groups (p = 0.621). PEG was easier to ingest for patients in the LV-PEG with TM group compared to the SV-PEG with SD group [visual analogue scale (VAS) for difficulty: 4.64 ± 2.46 vs. 5.97 ± 2.42, respectively; p < 0.001]. Diet instructions were also easier to comply with for patients in the LV-PEG with TM group compared to the SV-PEG with SD group (VAS for difficulty: 3.11 ± 2.25 vs. 4.00 ± 2.39, respectively; p = 0.008). Patients in the LV-PEG with TM group had a lower incidence of abdominal bloating (p = 0.012) and better sleep quality (p < 0.001). There was no difference between the groups regarding polyp and adenoma detection.LV-PEG with TM and SV-PEG with SD have similar efficacy with regard to bowel preparation for colonoscopy. LV-PEG with TM provided easier PEG intake and diet compliance, less abdominal bloating and better sleep quality than SV-PEG with SD.Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Intestinal permeability, systemic endotoxemia, and bacterial translocation after open or laparoscopic resection for colon cancer: a prospective randomized study.
Schietroma M1, Pessia B, Carlei F, Cecilia EM, Amicucci G.
Int J Colorectal Dis. 2013 Dec;28(12):1651-60. doi: 10.1007/s00384-013-1751-4. Epub 2013 Aug 6.
In this prospective randomized study, we investigated the effect of surgery on intestinal permeability (IP), endotoxemia, and bacterial translocation (BT) in patients undergoing elective colectomy for colon cancer by comparing the laparoscopic with the open approach.Seventy-two consecutive patients underwent colectomy for colon cancer: 35 cases open resection and 37 cases laparoscopic resection. IP was measured preoperatively and at days 1 and 3 after surgery. Serial venous blood sample were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min and at 12, 24, and 48 h after surgery for endotoxin measurement. Tissue sample were taken from the liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes and were weighed under sterile conditions.IP was significantly increased in the open and closed group at day 1 compared with the preoperative level (p < 0.05), but no difference was found between laparoscopic and open surgery group. The concentration endotoxin systemic increased significantly in the both group during the course of surgery but returned to baseline levels at the second day 2. No difference was found between laparoscopic and open surgery. A significant correlation was observed between the maximum systemic endotoxin concentration and IP measured at D1 in the open group and in the laparoscopic group. The incidence of BT increased in laparoscopic and open group after bowel mobilization, compared with the before mobilization (p < 0.05). There was not a statistically significant difference in BT value between the two groups.An increase in IP, systemic endotoxemia, and BT were observed during the open and laparoscopic resection for colon cancer, without significant statistically difference between the two groups.

Normal saline (NS) plus epinephrine (E) is the traditionally used solution as submucosal fluid cushion for a safe and effective endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of sessile colorectal polyps. It was hypothesized that hydroxyethyl starch (HES), an inexpensive and easily available solution might be an ideal solution for prolonged elevation of submucosal cushion for an easy and safe EMR of giant colorectal lateral spreading tumors (LSTs).During a 6-year period, patients suffering from colorectal LSTs with a diameter of ≥ 30 mm were randomized to undergo EMR by using either HES+E (group A) or NS+E (group B) for submucosal fluid cushion. All patients who had undergone a colonoscopy set the diagnosis of LSTs. The LSTs were examined with standard white light and narrow-band imaging to accurately delinate their margins before resection. The initial volume of injected solution, the additional amount to maintain the submucosal cushion, the duration of submucosal elevation and post-EMR-related complications were recorded. After EMR, patients had a standard follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months and further if it was necessary using total colonoscopy.Forty-nine patients suffering from giant LSTs were included in the study. No difference between the 2 groups was observed in patients' characteristics, size of LSTs, and the initial volume of injected solution. However, the additional amount of solution to maintain submucosal elevation was lower in group A (median, 4 mL; range, 2 to 25) than in group B (median, 6 mL; range, 3 to 8; P=0.001). Moreover, submucosal elevation had a statistically longer duration in group A (median, 18.5 min; range, 14.5 to 28.4) than in group B (median, 20.15 min, range, 9.6 to 13.4; P<0.001), and there was a statistical difference on total procedure time in favor of group A [group A, 20.15 min (12 to 32.5) vs. group B, 22.8 min (18 to 34.5)]. One case of macroperforation, 2 cases of postpolypectomy syndrome, and 1 case of EMR-related bleeding were observed in the HES+E group, whereas 6 cases of EMR-related bleeding were observed in the NS+E group. During a median follow-up of 32 and 34 months, for HES+E and NS+E groups, respectively, 5 and 7 recurrences were observed, which were all treated endoscopically.HES+E injection produces a more prolonged submucosal elevation and lowers total procedure time than NS+E; however, the safety of EMR is not influenced.

No consensus exists regarding the optimal bowel preparation regimen for patients with poor bowel cleansing at a previous colonoscopy.We investigated the usefulness of an intensive cleansing regimen for repeat colonoscopy after previous failure of bowel preparation.A prospective observational study was performed in patients undergoing colonoscopy at a university-based, tertiary referral hospital.Outpatients with inadequate preparation at an index colonoscopy were offered a repeat colonoscopy and instructed to follow an intensive preparation regimen consisting of a low-fiber diet for 72 hours, liquid diet for 24 hours, bisacodyl (10 mg) in the evening of the day before the colonoscopy, and a split dose of polyethylene glycol (1.5 L in the evening before and 1.5 L in the morning on the day of the colonoscopy).The adequacy of bowel cleansing was assessed according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (0 or 1 on any colon segment = inadequate bowel preparation). Procedural variables, detection rates for polyps and adenomas, compliance, and tolerability of the regimen were assessed. Satisfaction with the regimen was assessed with a 10-point visual analog scale.Of 83 patients with inadequate bowel preparation at colonoscopy, 51 underwent a second colonoscopy and were analyzed; 46 patients (90.2%) had adequate bowel cleansing at the second colonoscopy, with a mean (SD) total Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score of 7.43 (1.5) and scores of 2.31 (0.6) for the right colon, 2.49 (0.6) for the transverse colon, and 2.63 (0.6) for the left colon. Polyps, flat lesions, or flat lesions proximal to the splenic flexure were found in significantly more patients at the second colonoscopy than at the index colonoscopy. The global satisfaction score was 6.6 (2.7).The study was limited because of its open observational design, possible patient learning effect for bowel preparation at the repeat colonoscopy, and the inclusion of only outpatients.An intensive regimen consisting of a low-fiber diet, bisacodyl, and a split dose of polyethylene glycol can achieve good colon preparation with an improved detection rate for polyps and adenomas in most patients who have had poor bowel cleansing at a previous colonoscopy.

Mechanical bowel preparation is routinely done before colon and rectal surgery, aimed at reducing the risk of postoperative infectious complications. The aim of the study was to assess whether elective colon and rectal surgery can be safely performed without preoperative mechanical bowel preparation.Patients undergoing elective colon and rectal resections with primary anastomosis were prospectively randomized into two groups. Group A had mechanical bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol before surgery, and group B had their surgery without preoperative mechanical bowel preparation. Patients were followed up for 30 days for wound, anastomotic, and intra-abdominal infectious complications.Two hundred forty four patients were included in the study, 120 in group A and 124 in group B. Demographic characteristics, type of surgical procedure and type of anastomosis did not significantly differ between the two groups. There was no difference in the rate of surgical infectious complications between the two groups but the overall infectious complications rate was 20.0% in group A and 11.3% in group B (p .05). Wound infection (p = 0.18), anastomotic leak (p = 0.52), and intra-abdominal abscess (p = 0.36) occurred in 9.2%, 5.8%, and 5.0% versus 4.8%, 4.0%, and 2.4%, respectively. No mechanical bowel preparation seems to be safe also in rectal surgery.These results suggest that elective colon and rectal surgery may be safely performed without mechanical preparation.

Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2009 Dec 1;30(11-12):1110-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04147.x. Epub 2009 Sep 21.
As difficulty with evacuation is a common occurrence in individuals with spinal cord injury, preparation prior to colonoscopy may be suboptimal and, perhaps, more hazardous.To assess the safety and efficacy of bowel cleansing regimens in persons with spinal cord injury.Randomized, prospective, single blind study comparing polyethylene glycol (PEG), oral sodium phosphosoda (OSPS) and combination of both for colonic preparation prior to colonoscopy in subjects with spinal cord injury.Thirty six subjects with eGFR > or =60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were randomized to PEG or OSPS or PEG+OSPS. Regardless of bowel preparation employed, >73% of subjects had unacceptable colonic cleansing. No subject in the OSPS preparation group demonstrated a decrease in eGFR or an increase in serum creatinine concentration from the baseline. OSPS and PEG+OSPS preparations caused a transient change in serum potassium, phosphate and calcium concentrations, but no change in electrolytes was noted in the PEG group.Neither OSPS alone, PEG alone nor their combination was sufficient to prepare adequately the bowel for colonoscopy in most patients with spinal cord injury. However, administration of OSPS and/or PEG appears to be safe in the spinal cord injury population, provided adequate hydration is provided.

CDP860 is an engineered Fab' fragment-polyethylene glycol conjugate, which binds to and blocks the activity of the beta-subunit of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR-beta). Studies in animals have suggested that PDGFR-beta inhibition reduces tumor interstitial fluid pressure, and thus increases the uptake of concomitantly administered drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether changes in tumor vascular parameters could be detected in humans, and to assess whether CDP860 would be likely to increase the uptake of a concurrently administered small molecule in future studies.Patients with advanced ovarian or colorectal cancer and good performance status received intravenous infusions of CDP860 on days 0 and 28. Patients had serial dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging studies to measure changes in tumor vascular parameters.Three of eight patients developed significant ascites, and seven of eight showed evidence of fluid retention. In some patients, the ratio of vascular volume to total tumor volume increased significantly (P < .001) within 24 hours following CDP860 administration, an effect suggestive of recruitment of previously non-functioning vessels.These observations suggest that inhibition of PDGFR-beta might improve delivery of a concurrently administered therapy. However, in cancer patients, further exploration of the dosing regimen of CDP860 is required to dissociate adverse effects from beneficial effects. The findings challenge the view that inhibition of PDGF alone is beneficial, and confirm that effects of PDGFR kinase inhibition mediate, to some extent, the fluid retention observed in patients treated with mixed tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Prophylactic submucosal saline-adrenaline injection in colonoscopic polypectomy: prospective randomized study.
Dobrowolski S1, Dobosz M, Babicki A, Dymecki D, Hać S.
Surg Endosc. 2004 Jun;18(6):990-3. Epub 2004 Apr 27.
Endoscopic polypectomy is a standard method of treatment of gastrointestinal polyps, but is associated with substantial risk of complications. The most common is hemorrhage, the rate of which varied between 0.3%, and 6%. Various prophylactic techniques have been used to reduce this incidence. The aim of this study was to establish whether the prophylactic injection of adrenaline-saline solution reduces the risk of postpolypectomy bleeding in colonoscopic polypectomy.Between May 2000 and June 2002, patients with colorectal polyps of size > or =1 cm were randomized to receive submucosal epinephrine injection (group A) or no injection (group B). The polypectomies were carried out using the conventional method. In group A, epinephrine (1/10,000) was injected into the stalk or base of the polyp. The patients were observed for complications.A total of 69 patients with 100 polyps were enrolled in this study: n = 50 in group A, and n = 50 in group B, according to randomization. There were a total of nine episodes of postpolypectomy hemorrhage, one in the epinephrine group and eight in the control group (1/50 vs 8/50, p < 0.05). The bleeding correlated with the size of the polyps and the diameter of the stalks.Epinephrine injection prior to colonoscopic polypectomy is effective in preventing bleeding.

Comparison of reduced volume versus four liters sulfate-free electrolyte lavage solutions for colonoscopy colon cleansing.
DiPalma JA1, Wolff BG, Meagher A, Cleveland Mv.
Am J Gastroenterol. 2003 Oct;98(10):2187-91.
In an attempt to improve patient tolerance for colonoscopy cleansing, a reduced volume lavage regimen with 2 L sulfate-free electrolyte lavage solution (SF-ELS, NuLYTELY, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, MA) plus 20 mg p.o. bisacodyl (Half Lytely, Braintree Laboratories) was compared with standard 4 L SF-ELS lavage for safety and efficacy.At two centers, 200 patients undergoing colonoscopy for routine indications were randomized to receive the reduced volume or standard 4 L method. The day before scheduled colonoscopy, study subjects were allowed a normal breakfast and clear liquids for lunch and dinner. Those randomized to receive the reduced volume method received four 5-mg bisacodyl tablets p.o. at noon. Six hours later, they received 2 L SF-ELS given as 10 oz every 10 min. Subjects randomized to receive 4 L SF-ELS also drank their solution at 6:00 PM in a similar fashion. Colonoscopists, unaware as to the randomized preparation received, rated efficacy of cleansing. Patient tolerance and various hematological and biochemical parameters were assessed.Physician assessment of colon cleansing showed no differences between those patients randomized to receive reduced volume (n = 93) or 4 L (n = 93) SF-ELS cleansing (p = 0.16). There was a profound reduction in preparation side effects. The reduced volume preparation had less fullness (p < 0.01), nausea (p < 0.01), vomiting (p = 0.01), and overall discomfort (p < 0.01). There were no clinically significant changes in hematology or blood chemistry associated with either preparation.Reduced volume preparation with 2 L SF-ELS and bisacodyl is safe and effective. Clinical symptoms from the reduced volume preparation are significantly reduced compared with traditional 4 L gut lavage.

MR colonography: optimized enema composition.
Luboldt W1, Frohlich JM, Schneider N, Weishaupt D, Landolt F, Debatin JF.
Radiology. 1999 Jul;212(1):265-9.
Manganese chloride, iron glycerophosphate, and cellulose additive were assessed as base materials for use in a T1-shortening single contrast enema for magnetic resonance (MR) colonography. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were compared to those with the standard 10 mmol/L gadolinium-based enema. On T1-weighted three-dimensional gradient-recalled-echo images, CNRs with the iron glycerophosphate enema exceeded those with the manganese- and gadolinium-based enemas. Use of an additive of 0.8% wt/wt cellulose was found to be practicable as it increased viscosity sufficiently without altering CNR. The gadolinium-based enema can be replaced with an iron glycerophosphate enema to render MR colonography less costly.

Senna is more efficient than polyethylene glycol as mechanical preparation before elective colorectal surgery.Prospective, randomized, single-blind study.Multicenter study (18 centers).Five hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with colonic or rectal carcinoma or sigmoid diverticular disease, undergoing elective colonic or rectal resection followed by immediate anastomosis.Two hundred sixty-two patients were randomly allotted to receive senna (1 package diluted in a glass of water) and 261 to receive polyethylene glycol (2 packages diluted in 2-3 L of water), administered the evening before surgery. All patients received 5% povidone iodine antiseptic enemas (2 L) the evening and the morning before surgery. Ceftriaxone sodium and metronidazole were given intravenously at anesthetic induction.Degree of colonic and rectal cleanliness.Colonic cleanliness was better (P=.006), fecal matter in the colonic lumen was less fluid (P=.001), and the risk for moderate or large intraoperative fecal soiling was lower (P=.11) with senna. Overall, clinical tolerance did not differ significantly between groups, but 20 patients receiving polyethylene glycol (vs 16 with senna) had to interrupt their preparation, and 15 patients (vs 8 with senna) complained of abdominal distension. Senna, however, was better tolerated (P = .03) in the presence of stenosis. There was no statistically significant difference found in the number of patients with postoperative infective complications (14.7% vs 17.7%) or anastomotic leakage (5.3% vs 5.7%) with senna and polyethylene glycol, respectively.Mechanical preparation before colonic or rectal resection with senna is better and easier than with polyethylene glycol and should be proposed in patients undergoing colonic or rectal resection, especially patients with stenosis.

Barium enema preparation: a study of low-residue diet, "Picolax' and 'Kleen-Prep'.
Hawkins S1, Bezuidenhout P, Shorvon P, Hine A.
Australas Radiol. 1996 Aug;40(3):235-9.
A prospective, randomized three-arm trial is presented of 150 consecutive patients attending for double-contrast barium enema (BE). This compares 'Picolax' (a combined stimulant and osmotic agent), 'Picolax' following a 3 day low-residue diet and 'Kleen-Prep' (a polyethylene-glycol osmotic agent). Faecal clearance, mucosal coating and colon fluid were scored in four colonic segments by two radiologists working independently and blinded to the preparation used. Analyses of an elderly subgroup and of side effects was performed. Low-residue diet conferred no benefit to Picolax preparation, which was satisfactory (ability to exclude 5 mm polyps) in 80% of patients. Kleen-Prep failed to achieve adequate preparation in 46%, due to excess fluid and poor mucosal coating. Kleen-Prep caused more patient nausea, abdominal bloating and pain than Picolax. Patients 70 years and older had similar results. Low-residue diet need not be used in addition to Picolax. Kleen-Prep as a single agent is not recommended for BE preparation.

Br J Anaesth. 1991 Mar;66(3):292-9.
We have studied the effect of intraoperative body heat conservation and 24-h thermoneutrality on postoperative whole body protein turnover using stable isotope methodology in a group of elderly patients undergoing colorectal surgery for rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma. Two groups of eight patients were studied. One group (control, or cold) received routine intraoperative and postoperative care. All patients in the second group (warmed) were maintained at normothermia during anaesthesia and surgery; these patients were nursed after surgery in a warm room (ambient temperature 28-30 degrees C) for a period of 24 h. General anaesthesia, surgical care and nutritional support were similar in both groups. A constant nutritional intake, based on nitrogen 0.1 g kg-1 day-1 and energy 20 kcal kg-1 day-1, was provided orally for 7 days before surgery and i.v. after operation for 4 consecutive days. Whole body protein breakdown and synthesis, as assessed by stable isotope methodology, increased significantly 2 and 4 days after surgery in both groups (P less than 0.01), but the increase in protein breakdown in the warmed group on day 2 was significantly less than that in the cold group (P less than 0.05). The increase in leucine oxidation in the warmed group on the 2nd day after surgery was not significant, and was less than the increase observed in the cold group (P less than 0.05). However, by the 4th day, leucine oxidation was enhanced significantly in both groups (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).

Crisnatol mesylate: phase I dose escalation by extending infusion duration.
Poplin EA1, Chabot GG, Tuttle RL, Lucas S, Wargin WA, Baker LH.
Invest New Drugs. 1991 Feb;9(1):41-7.
Crisnatol mesylate is a rationally designed cytotoxic arylmethylamino-propanediol with broad spectrum cytotoxic activity. A phase I study with an unconventional escalation scheme was developed using a constant drug infusion rate (mg/m2/hr) and prolonging the infusion duration from 6 to 96 hours. Sixty-five patients received crisnatol at doses from 18 mg/m2 in 6 hrs to 3400 mg/m2 in 72 hours. The dose-limiting toxicity in two of five patients at 2700 mg/m2 and two of three patients at 3400 mg/m2 was neurologic and consisted of a syndrome of confusion, agitation, and disorientation. Phlebitis mandated the use of a central line. The mean terminal phase half-life (T1/2 beta) was 3.3 hours with a total body clearance (CL) of 22.8 L/hr/m2 and a volume of distribution (Vdss) of 53 L/m2. The median steady-state peak plasma concentration (Css) at 2700 mg/m2/72 hours was 2.7 micrograms/ml and at 3400 mg/m2/72 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. No responses were seen. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on this schedule is 2700 mg/m2/72 hours in patients with no liver disease and good performance status.

Beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the treatment of postoperative adynamic ileus.
Hallerbäck B, Carlsen E, Carlsson K, Enkvist C, Glise H, Haffner J, Innes R, Kirnö K.
Scand J Gastroenterol. 1987 Mar;22(2):149-55.
Abdominal trauma, such as surgery and peritonitis, leads to inhibition of intestinal motility, partly mediated by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. To investigate the effect of nonselective beta-blockade on adynamic ileus, propranolol was compared with placebo in the postoperative course after elective colonic surgery in a double-blind randomized study. Ten patients received 4 mg propranolol intravenously twice daily, and ten received 10 mg intravenously twice daily. Nineteen patients received placebo. The time to first passage of stool was 110 +/- 9 h in the placebo group and 82 +/- 11 h in the 4-mg propranolol group. In the 10-mg propranolol group, the time was 79 +/- 8 h. The difference between the placebo-treated group and the propranolol-treated groups was significant (p less than 0.01). The effect of propranolol was most marked in older patients and after surgery on the distal colon. In patients older than 60 years the time to first stool in the placebo group was 127 +/- 13 h (n = 8), compared with 73 +/- 8 h (n = 11) in the propranolol group (p less than 0.01). In patients who had undergone surgery on the distal colon the time to first stool was 125 +/- 13 h (n = 8) in the placebo group and 76 +/- 8 h (n = 11) for propranolol (p less than 0.01). Adverse effects on the respiratory or cardiovascular system were not seen during medication. It is concluded that propranolol shortens the period of adynamic ileus after colonic surgery.

The efficacy of polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution versus traditional mechanical bowel preparation for elective colonic surgery: a randomized, prospective, blinded clinical trial.
Fleites RA, Marshall JB, Eckhauser ML, Mansour EG, Imbembo AL, McCullough AJ.
Surgery. 1985 Oct;98(4):708-17.
This study documents the efficacy, safety and patient tolerance of GoLYTELY (Braintree Laboratories, Inc., Braintree, Mass.) an orally administered, nonexplosive, polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution, in elective colonic surgery. Fifty-three patients admitted for colonic surgery were randomized to either GoLYTELY or a traditional 3-day bowel preparation. Both groups received oral and perioperative antibiotics. Pre- and postpreparation weights, blood chemistries, and hematologic values were obtained. Postpreparation patient tolerance was assessed. During surgery the surgeon scored the bowel for the presence of retained air, fluid, or feces. Standardized semiquantitative aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts were obtained from sigmoid aspirates. Postoperative infectious complications were recorded. Mechanical preparation with GoLYTELY resulted in a greater feeling of fullness, while the traditional preparation produced more hunger and abdominal cramping. The use of GoLYTELY resulted in better scores of overall quality and bowel appearance, reflecting a greater efficiency with which it removed air, fluid, and feces from the bowel. GoLYTELY also resulted in significantly fewer total aerobic and anaerobic organisms in sigmoid aspirates. This study suggests that GoLYTELY is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective orthograde lavage solution that has significant advantages over other mechanical preparations and should be considered the preparation of choice for elective colonic surgery.

Phase II studies of dianhydrogalactitol and VP-16-213 in colorectal cancer.
Perry MC, Moertel CG, Schutt AJ, Reitemeier RJ, Hahn RG.
Cancer Treat Rep. 1976 Sep;60(9):1247-50.
Phase II chemotherapy trials of dianhydrogalactitol and VP-16-213 were conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had measurable malignant disease which served as indicators of response to therapy. Dianhydrogalactitol was given in a 5-day course at a dosage of 30 mg/m2/day. Toxic reactions included nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. There was a definite tendency to a compounding of hematologic toxicity with repeated courses. No evidence of objective therapeutic response was observed among 30 patients treated. VP-16-213 was given at a dosage of 130 mg/m2 on Days 1, 3, and 5. Toxic reactions included nausea, vomiting, alopecia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Hematologic toxicity was more severe in patients with elevated serum bilirubin levels. No evidence of objective therapeutic response was observed among 28 patients treated.
